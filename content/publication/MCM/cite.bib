ABSTRACT = {Soil microorganisms are integral to maintaining soil health and crop productivity, but fumigation used to suppress soilborne diseases may affect soil microbiota. Currently, little is known about the legacy effects of soil fumigation on soil microbial communities and their response to fumigation at the production scale. Here, 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial and fungal communities in soils from intensively managed crop fields with and without previous exposure to metam sodium (MS) fumigation. The effect of fumigation history, soil series, and rotation crop diversity on microbial community variation was estimated and the response of the soil microbiome to MS application in an open microcosm system was documented.},
